# RL-AFEC: Adaptive Forward Error Correction for Real-time Video Communication Based on Reinforcement Learning
This is a Tensorflow implementation of RL-AFEC
# Prerequisites
Python 3.8.5, Tensorflow v2.2.0 (CPU version)

# Training
To train an RL-AFEC agent, put the trace file (e.g., video_RL_train.txt) in data/, then specify the file name in config.py, i.e., trace_file = 'video_RL_train.txt' and then run
